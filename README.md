Self learning symbolic system for speech recognition 

## Introduction: 
Automatic Speech Recognition system requires deep learning with huge amount of data and computational power. Problem with ASR are, they lack reasoning. Infants learn new languages in a self organizing manner. The goal of this library (hopefully) is to mimic the functionalities of human infants.
