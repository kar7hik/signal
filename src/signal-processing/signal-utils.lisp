;; Discrete Fourier Transform ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) computes an infinite number of frequency bins,
;;; and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) picks out a finite number of those.

;;; Zero padding for FFT:

;;; https://www.mechanicalvibration.com/Zero_Padding_FFTs.html
;; "Zero-padding" means adding additional zeros to a sample of data
;; FFT is slow for prime numbers, but much faster for powers of two. We can add an extra
;; zero to the end of the sample and thus get much better performance.

;; The other reason that zero-padding is used is to get better frequency resolution
;; Zero padding allows us to take more samples of the DTFT.
;; For example, if we have 1000 points of data, sampled at 1000 Hz, and perform the standard
;; FFT, we get a frequency bin every 1 Hz. But if we pad with 1000 zeros and then run a 2000
;; point FFT, now we get frequency bins every 0.5 Hz. This allows us to get around some of
;; the disadvantages of the DFT
